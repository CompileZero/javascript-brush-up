# The javascript Brush Up Kit

## A beginner-friendly curated Javascript Guide Kit to master the basic concepts of JavaScript

### `Inspired from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course: Modern JavaScript from The Beginning`

#### These are my personal notes while learning JavaScript. We tend to forget many things while learning to code. This repo serves a brush up of JavaScript Concepts, with cheatsheets and simple-projects for you to glance over the code.

## Using the cheatsheets

###### Every file in the cheatsheets folder is segregated according to the concepts, from beginner to advanced. They are deliberately kept as .js files as it is easier to find the code you're searching that way.

## using the Projects

###### Every Project has a readme file with the following:
    1. Pre-requisites (What you should be familier with)
    2. A problem statement with clear expected output
    3. The concepts learnt during the project
    4. The steps to code the project
    5. A clear commented source code for reference.

### For Students

Students can use the cheatsheets for reference, and projects to brush up concepts of JavaScript.

### For Teachers

Teachers can use the cheatsheets for their and the students' reference, and projects to test the students of the JavaScript Skills.

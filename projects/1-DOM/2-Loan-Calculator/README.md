## 🌮 Steps

1. Create a basic HTML layout & import Materialize CSS (CDN) dependencies.

   > 💡 Tip: Materialize CSS also needs JQuery as a dependency to work, so use the JQuery CDN, and put the script code above materialize script code.

2. Import Font Awesome (CDN).

   > 💡 Tip: Use the CSS cdn in the `head` & use the JS cdn below the `body`

3. The HTML Layout contains 2 cards stacked

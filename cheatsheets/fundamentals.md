# 5 Types of Primitive Types
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined

#### Technically there are 2 more: Symbol & BigInt

## Numbers
1. JS has only 1 numbers, (as opposed to java,and C++ where we have int,float, double etc.), which can be whole numbers, integers ( + / - ), and decimal numbers
2. Does not store infinitely precise numbers (eg. 1.00090909090903 will give output **1**)
3. 5 ** 2 = 5 to the power 2 = 25
4. Arithmetic Operations follow BODMAS rule
5. NaN = Not a number
   1. 0 / 0 = NaN
   2. 1 + NaN = NaN
   3. 1/0 = Infinity (there's no way to store Infinity)
   4. -0 = -0 (This has its own value in JavaScript, Super Weird!)

# 2. What is JavaScript?

Before answering this question, lets talk about where JS is used?

I‘m sure you‘ve seen a Create-Account Page: ![Login UI Page](./media/UI_1.jpg)

In the above image:

1. There is a toggle-button group, asking whether you are a “Brand/Business” or
   an “Agency”
2. There are 4 text-fields, which ask for your personal details.
3. There are 2 checkboxes, which ask whether you agree to the terms and whether
   you want to sign up to newsletter
4. And finally, there is the “Create Account” Button.

Now let’s look at this image from the Web-Browser‘s Perspective (Take Google
Chrome for example):

1. There is an HTML Code which tells the browser the following:
   1. The page contains 3 labels, 2 toggle-buttons, 4 text-fields, 2 checkboxes
      and a submit-button.
   2. There is a parent “div”(group) which contains all the above components,
      and some child “div(s)” which separate groups of components(there is a div
      for the toggle-buttons, text-fields and checkboxes)
2. There is a CSS code which tells the browser:
   1. That the highlight color for all those components is blue
   2. The font-family is Montserrat
   3. The text-color is gray
   4. And many more attributes like spacing, width and height, margin, padding
      etc. of the components.
3. Finally, there is another script (PS: It’s JavaScript) that tells the
   browser:
   1. What to do when the user clicks on “Agency” Toggle Button
   2. Which error message to display when all the text-fields are not filled
      correctly.
   3. What to do when “Sign up” Checkbox is checked/unchecked.
   4. And finally, what action(s) to take when “Create Account” button is
      clicked.

## 2.1. The definition:

JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or
just-in-time compiled object-oriented language with first-class functions. While
it is well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser
environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language,
supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
programming) styles.

Let’s go over all those terms one-by-one:

Firstly, JS (From now on, I will be referring to JavaScript® as **JS** for
simplicity) is a language that

Simply Put, JavaScript was initially created to make web-pages alive.
